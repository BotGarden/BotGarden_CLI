# Bot Garden

Bot Garden is a Discord bot-building framework inspired by a local community garden in my parentsâ€™ neighbourhood at which members grow fruits, vegetables, and flowers to share with each other. Like a local community garden, the developer environment and boilerplate code created using this framework aims to become a nexus of collaboration, sharing, and growth for a Discord server community.

## Quick Start

1. First, inside of the root directory, install `node_modules` using `npm install`.

2. Then, run `npm link` to create a sym-link to run the cli.

3. At this point you are able to run the CLI to initialize a garden (using `botgarden create-garden`), initialize a new bot from within the garden (using `botgarden create-bot`), or initialize a new bot command (using `botgarden create-command`).
