# Bot Garden

Bot Garden is a Discord bot-building framework inspired by a local community garden in my parentsâ€™ neighbourhood at which members grow fruits, vegetables, and flowers to share with each other. Like a local community garden, the developer environment and boilerplate code created using this framework aims to become a nexus of collaboration, sharing, and growth for a Discord server community.
